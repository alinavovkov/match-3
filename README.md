# Match-3 Game

A simple **Match-3 game** implemented using **Vanilla TypeScript** and **Canvas**.

Players can click on two tiles to swap them. If a match of 3, 4, 5 identical tiles is formed (horizontally or vertically), the tiles disappear, new tiles fall from above, and the board refills automatically.

### Features

- 8Ã—8 board with 5 tile types (colored squares)
- Animated falling tiles
- Match detection: 3, 4, or 5 in a row
- Smooth tile swapping and rollback on invalid moves
- Glowing tile borders and red error glow for invalid swaps
- Prevents double-clicks and repeated clicks on the same tile
- User messages for feedback (e.g., successful move, same tile)
